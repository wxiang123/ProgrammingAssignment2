## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and their may be some benefit to caching
## the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly 

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }   ##set the matrix
  get <- function() x   ##get the matrix
  setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve  ##set the inverse matrix
  getinverse <- function() m  ##、get the inverse matrix
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
##makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
##(and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve
##the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
